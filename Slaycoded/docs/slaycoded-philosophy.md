# ðŸŒŸ Slaycoded Philosophy

Slaycoded isn't simplifying; it's clarifying. Built on:

- **Human Cognition**: Align with natural sensory and cognitive processes.
- **Contextual Clarity**: Always explain the 'why' behind each action.
- **Conciseness**: Detailed, yet free of redundancy or fluff.
- **Respect**: Assume intelligence without patronizing.

Documentation should be a seamless experience, not a chore.
